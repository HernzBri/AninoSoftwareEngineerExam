Unfinished

unity 2019.2.9f1

There is a Game Controller that handles all logical computations, and there is a script that spins the reel and detect what id it stopped.

I created a Scriptable object for Payout Matches, but I was not able to finish them


unfortunately I was not able to finish it, due to unforseen circumstance, I am sleep deprived and I will accept the outcome of this exam.
